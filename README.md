Since its inception, the investors have been facing the challenging tasks like trying to predict the stockâ€™s future prices, finding the right stock to buy, finding the correct timing to cash out the stock and many more. With the advancement of fields like the machine learning and data mining, the number of financial players mining the unstructured data have seen sharp increase in the last decade. This could be helpful in allowing the prediction of some of the patterns.

The objective of this project included the analysis of data and to recommend recent hot and safe stocks for the investors to pick relatively. This project shows an example of implementing regression for predicting stock market prices with the help of Support Vector Machines.

## Problem Statement
