# Safe Stock Prediction
The erratic nature of stock market makes it extremely difficult to predict. Since its inception, the investors have been facing the challenging tasks like trying to predict the stockâ€™s future prices, finding the right stock to buy, finding the correct timing to cash out the stock and many more. With the advancement of fields like the machine learning and data mining, the number of financial players mining the unstructured data have seen sharp increase in the last decade. This could be helpful in allowing the prediction of some of the patterns.

The objective of this project included the analysis of data and to recommend recent hot and safe stocks for the investors to pick relatively. This project shows an example of implementing regression for predicting stock market prices with the help of Support Vector Machines.

## Problem Statement
Develop a predictive model to recommend investors to find the stocks which are safe to buy relative to their interested investment fields.

## Regression
Regression is a form of predictive modelling technique with helps is investiagting the relation between the target or dependent variable and the predictor or independent variable(s). This has various uses like time series modelling, forecasting etc. In regression, we fit a line to the data points such that the differences between the distances of the data points from the curve is minimized.

## Implementation

### Data collection and Data Preprocesing
Data was collected from yahoo finance for last 30 days. The downloaded data is in the form of a CSV file. The file is read and converted into pandas dataframe. Preprocessing was an important step for the model as data downloaded from Yahoo Finance contains data which is of no use to the predicting model. Unnecessary data was to be removed from the input file like volume of stocks and other parameters which were of no use to the model.
